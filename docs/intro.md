Credible is a lightweight, app-store-approved wallet for individuals to manage DIDs and VCs from their mobile phones. It is white-label friendly, open-source, and build on our core SSI libraries.  Over time, we expect to integrate many DID methods and presentation protocols to make this the wallet fully-featured without being ledger-bound or vendor-favoring.

## Features

* QR support to initiate and execute issuance and presentation of verifiable credentials
* Handy interface for generating multiple DIDs (and coming soon, multiple DIDs on multiple ledgers)
* Official wallet of DID Method Tezos (DID:tz)
* Built in Flutter, for leaner, faster builds and less dependencies

## Coming soon

The following features have been tentatively roadmapped for the next major release:
1. Better support (and code snippets) for passing OIDC tokens back to service authenticated with Credible
